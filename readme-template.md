A modern list api for Emacs. No 'cl required.

## Installation

It's available on [marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and [Melpa](https://melpa.org/):

    M-x package-install dash

Or you can just dump `dash.el` in your load
path somewhere.

If you want the function combinators, then also:

    M-x package-install dash-functional

## Using in a package

Add this to the big comment block at the top:

    ;; Package-Requires: ((dash "2.13.0"))

To get function combinators:

    ;; Package-Requires: ((dash "2.13.0") (dash-functional "1.2.0") (emacs "24"))

## Upcoming breaking change!

- For backward compatibility reasons `-zip` return a cons-cell instead of a list
  with two elements when called on two lists. This is a clunky API, and in an
  upcoming 3.0 release of Dash it will always return a list. If you rely on the
  cons-cell return value, use `-zip-pair` instead.

## Syntax highlighting of dash functions

Font lock of dash functions in emacs lisp buffers is now optional.
Include this in your emacs settings to get syntax highlighting:

    (eval-after-load 'dash '(dash-enable-font-lock))

## Functions

All functions and constructs in the library are prefixed with a dash (-).

There are also anaphoric versions of functions where that makes sense,
prefixed with two dashes instead of one.

While `-map` takes a function to map over the list, you can also use
the anaphoric form with double dashes - which will then be executed
with `it` exposed as the list item. Here's an example:

```el
(-map (lambda (n) (* n n)) '(1 2 3 4)) ;; normal version

(--map (* it it) '(1 2 3 4)) ;; anaphoric version
```

of course the original can also be written like

```el
(defun square (n) (* n n))

(-map 'square '(1 2 3 4))
```

which demonstrates the usefulness of both versions.

## Contribute

Yes, please do. Pure functions in the list manipulation realm only,
please. There's a suite of tests in `dev/examples.el`, so remember to add
tests for your function, or I might break it later.

You'll find the repo at:

    https://github.com/magnars/dash.el

Run the tests with

    ./run-tests.sh

Create the docs with

    ./create-docs.sh

I highly recommend that you install these as a pre-commit hook, so that
the tests are always running and the docs are always in sync:

    cp pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit

Oh, and don't edit `README.md` directly, it is auto-generated.
Change `readme-template.md` or `examples-to-docs.el` instead.

## Changelist

### From 2.12 to 2.13

- `-let` now supports `&alist` in destructuring.
- Various performance improvements.
- `-zip` will change in future so it always returns lists. Added
  `-zip-pair` for users who explicitly want the old behavior.
- Added lexical binding pragma to dash.el, fixes
  [#130](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el/issues/130) in Emacs 24+.
- Added `-select-column` and `-select-columns`.
- Fixed an issue with `-map-last` and `--remove-last` where they
  modified their inputs
  ([#158](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el/issues/158)).
- Added `-each-indexed` and `--each-indexed`.
- Added `-take-last` and `-drop-last`.
- Added `-doto` macro.
